## Project Overview

This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Streamlit. The application captures live video from a webcam and recognizes four distinct static hand gestures with high accuracy and minimal latency, demonstrating advanced computer vision capabilities for Human-Computer Interaction applications.

## Technology Justification

### MediaPipe for Hand Detection
- **Choice:** Google's MediaPipe framework for hand landmark detection
- **Justification:** MediaPipe provides state-of-the-art hand tracking with 21 high-precision landmarks per hand, enabling robust feature extraction for gesture classification. It offers excellent real-time performance (30+ FPS) and accuracy compared to traditional computer vision methods like Haar cascades or HOG descriptors. The pre-trained models are optimized for mobile and web deployment, making them ideal for real-time applications with minimal computational overhead.

### OpenCV for Computer Vision Pipeline
- **Choice:** OpenCV (cv2) for video capture and image processing operations
- **Justification:** OpenCV is the industry standard for computer vision tasks, providing efficient video capture, frame processing, and drawing utilities. Its mature ecosystem and extensive documentation make it reliable for production applications. The library's optimized C++ backend ensures high-performance real-time video processing.

### Streamlit for Interactive Web Interface
- **Choice:** Streamlit framework for creating the web-based user interface
- **Justification:** Streamlit enables rapid development of interactive web applications with minimal code, perfect for demonstrating real-time computer vision applications. It provides seamless integration with OpenCV and MediaPipe, allowing for easy deployment and sharing without complex web development knowledge. The framework's reactive programming model is ideal for real-time applications.

### Rule-Based Classification Architecture
- **Choice:** Geometric analysis of hand landmarks for gesture recognition
- **Justification:** Rule-based classification using finger positions and orientations provides interpretable, fast, and reliable results for the four target gestures without requiring extensive training data or computational resources. This approach ensures consistent performance across different users, hand sizes, and lighting conditions while maintaining real-time processing speeds.

## Gesture Logic Explanation

The system recognizes gestures through systematic analysis of hand landmarks provided by MediaPipe:

### 1. Open Palm Detection
- **Algorithm:** Finger extension analysis using landmark position comparison
- **Implementation:** 
  - Compares fingertip positions (landmarks 8, 12, 16, 20) with PIP joints (landmarks 6, 10, 14, 18)
  - Uses y-coordinate comparison to determine if fingers are extended upward
  - Threshold: 4 or more fingers extended = Open Palm
- **Confidence Scoring:** 
  - High (90%): All 5 fingers clearly extended
  - Moderate (60%): 3-4 fingers extended
- **Edge Cases:** Handles partial visibility and slight finger curvature

### 2. Fist Recognition
- **Algorithm:** Closed finger detection through landmark analysis
- **Implementation:**
  - Verifies all fingertips are positioned below their respective PIP joints
  - Accounts for natural hand curvature in closed position
  - Binary classification: all fingers down = Fist
- **Confidence Scoring:**
  - High (90%): No fingers extended, tight fist formation
  - Moderate (60%): Loose fist with minimal finger extension
- **Robustness:** Tolerates partial occlusion and hand orientation variations

### 3. Peace Sign (V-Sign) Classification
- **Algorithm:** Specific finger pattern matching with geometric validation
- **Implementation:**
  - Binary pattern matching: [thumb=0, index=1, middle=1, ring=0, pinky=0]
  - Additional separation check between index and middle fingers
  - Orientation verification to ensure upward pointing
- **Confidence Scoring:**
  - Very High (95%): Exact pattern match with proper finger separation
  - Moderate (70%): Approximate match with slight variations
- **Validation:** Ensures sufficient angular separation between extended fingers

### 4. Thumbs Up Detection
- **Algorithm:** Thumb orientation analysis with supporting finger validation
- **Implementation:**
  - Primary check: Thumb extension detection (landmark 4 vs landmark 3)
  - Orientation verification: Thumb tip above wrist (landmark 0) by 30+ pixels
  - Supporting validation: Other fingers in closed position
- **Confidence Scoring:**
  - High (90%): Clear upward thumb orientation with closed fingers
  - Moderate (70%): Angled thumb position with partial finger closure
- **Orientation Logic:** Uses y-coordinate comparison between thumb tip and wrist landmark
